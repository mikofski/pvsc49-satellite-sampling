abstract = {The degradation rate plays an important role in predicting and assessing the long-term energy generation of photovoltaics (PV) systems. Many methods have been proposed for extracting the degradation rate from operational data of PV systems, but most of the published approaches are susceptible to bias due to inverter clipping, module soiling, temporary outages, seasonality, and sensor degradation. In this paper, we propose a methodology for determining PV degradation leveraging available modeled clear-sky irradiance data rather than site sensor data, and a robust year-over-year rate calculation. We show the method to provide reliable degradation rate estimates even in the case of sensor drift, data shifts, and soiling. Compared with alternate methods, we demonstrate that the proposed method delivers the lowest uncertainty in degradation rate estimates for a fleet of 486 PV systems},

abstract = {A surface radiation budget observing network (SURFRAD) has been established for the United States to support satellite retrieval validation, modeling, and climate, hydrology, and weather research. The primary measurements are the downwelling and upwelling components of broadband solar and thermal infrared irradiance. A hallmark of the network is the measurement and computation of ancillary parameters important to the transmission of radiation. SURFRAD commenced operation in 1995. Presently, it is made up of six stations in diverse climates, including the moist subtropical environment of the U.S. southeast, the cool and dry northern plains, and the hot and arid desert southwest. Network operation involves a rigorous regimen of frequent calibration, quality assurance, and data quality control. An efficient supporting infrastructure has been created to gather, check, and disseminate the basic data expeditiously. Quality controlled daily processed data files from each station are usually available via the Internet within a day of real time. Data from SURFRAD have been used to validate measurements from NASA's Earth Observing System series of satellites, satellite-based retrievals of surface erythematogenic radiation, the national ultraviolet index, and real-time National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) products. It has also been used for carbon sequestration studies, to check radiative transfer codes in various physical models, for basic research and instruction at universities, climate research, and for many other applications. Two stations now have atmospheric energy flux and soil heat flux instrumentation, making them full surface energy balance sites. It is hoped that eventually all SURFRAD stations will have this capability.},

abstract = {This paper validates the performance of the physics-based Physical Solar Model (PSM) data set in the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB) to quantify the accuracy of the magnitude and the spatial and temporal variability of the solar radiation data. Achieving higher penetrations of solar energy on the electric grid and reducing integration costs requires accurate knowledge of the available solar resource. Understanding the impacts of clouds and other meteorological constituents on the solar resource and quantifying intra-/inter-hour, seasonal, and interannual variability are essential for accurately designing utility-scale solar energy projects. Solar resource information can be obtained from ground-based measurement stations and/or from modeled data sets. The availability of measurements is scarce, both temporally and spatially, because it is expensive to maintain a high-density solar radiation measurement network that collects good quality data for long periods of time. On the other hand, high temporal and spatial resolution gridded satellite data can be used to estimate surface radiation for long periods of time and is extremely useful for solar energy development. Because of the advantages of satellite-based solar resource assessment, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed the PSM. The PSM produced gridded solar irradiance -- global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance -- for the NSRDB at a 4-km by 4-km spatial resolution and half-hourly temporal resolution covering the 18 years from 1998-2015. The NSRDB also contains additional ancillary meteorological data sets, such as temperature, relative humidity, surface pressure, dew point, and wind speed. Details of the model and data are available at https://nsrdb.nrel.gov.},

This relationship is compared to the relationship established by Orgill and Hollands and to a set of data from Highett, Australia, and agreement is within a few percent in both cases. The transient simulation program TRNSYS is used to calculate the annual performance of solar energy systems using several correlations. For the systems investigated, the effect of simulating the random distribution of the hourly diffuse fraction is negligible. A seasonally dependent daily diffuse correlation is developed from the data, and this daily relationship is used to derive a correlation for the monthly-average diffuse fraction.}

Furthermore, for modules within the range of construction parameters employed in this study, the actual values of the two modified HWB constants do not appear to depend upon module type.

Rebate applications in California require results from the CEC PV model, and thus depend on an up-to-date database of module characteristics. Currently, adding new modules to the database requires calculating operational coefficients using a general purpose equation solver—a cumbersome process for the 300þ modules added on average every month. The combination of empirical regressions and heuristic methods presented herein achieve automated convergence for 99.87% of the 5487 modules in the CEC database and greatly enhance the accuracy and efficiency by which new modules can be characterized and approved for use. The added robustness also permits general purpose use of the CEC=6 parameter module model by modelers and system analysts when standard module specifications are known, even if the module does not exist in a preprocessed database.},

@article{Muller2014,
abstract = {Solar resource assessments use solar radiation data from past observations to estimate the average annual solar radiation over the expected lifetime for a solar energy system. However, solar radiation at the Earth's surface is not stable over time but undergoes signif- icant long-term variations often referred to as “global dimming and brightening”. This study analyzes the effect of these long-term trends on solar resource assessments. Based on long-term measurement records in Germany, it is found that the additional uncertainty of solar resource assessments caused by long-term trends in solar radiation is about 3% on the horizontal plane and even higher for tilted or tracked planes. These additional uncertainties are not included in most uncertainty calculations for solar resource assessments up to now. Furthermore, for the measurement stations analyzed, the current irradiance level is about 5% above the long-term average of the years 1951–2010. Since the direction of future trends in solar radiation is not known, different possibilities to estimate the future solar resource are compared. In view of long-term trends that could extend beyond the period of past observations and beyond the projected lifetime of a solar energy application, a paradigm shift is proposed: instead of using the longest possible period to calculate an average value, only the 10 most recent years should be used as the estimator for future solar irradiance.},

abstract  = {Utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems are generally designed with a greater DC power capacity than their inverters are capable of converting to AC power, resulting in system clipping. Modeling tools used to forecast the generation of photovoltaic systems predict the degree to which a system is expected to clip throughout the year. However, standard PV modeling software utilizes an input of hourly meteorological data to predict these losses. For periods of intermittent irradiance in which the incident irradiance at times may cause the system to clip, an average of this irradiance over the course of an hour may result in a prediction which fails to encompass clipping losses for those intermittent intervals. Presented within this paper is a model for predicting these losses by averaging high-resolution datasets and comparing losses through the NREL developed modeling tool System Advisor Model. This prediction model utilizes freely available data through the National Solar Radiation Database to predict these losses, so the methodology presented allows users and developers to predict subhourly clipping losses at a site where minute-resolution ground data would otherwise be unavailable.},

abstract  = {Under-performance of solar PV systems is an important issue that increases risks for stakeholders, including developers, investors and operators. Recently some attention has focused on underestimation of inverter clipping losses as a possible source of over-prediction where sub-hourly solar variability is high. Several models and data sets have been analyzed over the past few years, with the aim of quantifying, predicting, and correcting underestimated clipping loss errors for systems with high DC/AC ratio and solar variability. In this research, we apply a machine learning model developed at NREL to two physical PV systems, to correct for subhourly clipping losses. For each system, we compare overall AC power output for the model taken at 1-minute intervals to AC power output taken at 1-hour intervals with the addition of the subhourly clipping correction. Our findings consistently show that the addition of the clipping loss correction lead to a reduction in mean bias error of 0.8% and 1.2% for systems A and B, respectively, with no additional filtering applied. When examining high solar variability periods where clipping is more pronounced, system A and B experienced a 1.8% and 2.7% reduction in mean bias error, respectively, when the clipping correction was applied.},

abstract  = {High-frequency measurements of solar resource from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PV test-bed in Gaithersburg, MD were down-sampled from 1-minute to 1-hour and used to predict energy yield and clipping losses. Three virtual systems based on the NIST ground array with increasing DC/AC ratio were compared. With hourly input, clipping losses were smaller and energy yield was larger than predictions with high-frequency input. Systems with higher DC/AC ratio were more sensitive to time-resolution. The average difference between hourly and 1-minute predicted energy yield was 2% during the month of July for a DC/AC ratio of 1.3. These results demonstrate the importance of high-frequency solar resource in climates with solar variability to avoid over-predictions of energy yield for inverter blocks with a DC/AC ratio greater than one. The results of this study were implemented to develop a sub-hourly clipping adjustment factor for a pre-construction project site codenamed, "Orion," near Northbridge, Massachusetts.},
